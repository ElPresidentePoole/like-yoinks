# like-yoinks
A simple script to convert all of your Twitter likes to an importable list of bookmarks.

# Usage

Replace your handle and bearer_token with your handle and bearer token and run like_yoinks.py.  This will fetch every like on the account found and save it to ./likes.txt and ./bookmarks.html.

./likes.txt will have the url of each like, separated by a newline.  ./bookmarks.html can be imported into Firefox easily.
